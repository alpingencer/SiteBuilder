## About SiteBuilder

SiteBuilder is a page management and HTML auto-generation framework for PHP written by Alpin Gencer.

## Installation

Because v3.0 Lithium is the first version of SiteBuilder to include Composer support, v2.0 Helium
only has a manual installation process.

In order to use v2.0, clone the "v2" branch under the "SiteBuilder" directory in your server
document root. Afterwards, you can include the file "SiteBuilder/SiteBuilder.inc" and get started.

## License

The SiteBuilder framework is open-sourced software licensed under
